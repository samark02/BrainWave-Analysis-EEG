# NeuroAI üß†

An AI-based approach for analyzing brain waves using EEG data to support accurate seizure detection and neurological diagnosis.

## Project Overview

Neurological disorders like seizures are unpredictable and challenging to diagnose precisely. This project uses AI models with EEG data to provide better, faster, and more objective insights for healthcare professionals.

## Current Scope

- Analyze EEG signals to detect abnormal brainwave patterns.
- Design deep learning models (LSTM/CNN) for seizure recovery prediction.
- Expand diagnosis by combining EEG data with MRI scans and patient history.

## Repository

- üìÅ **model.ipynb** ‚Äî Core notebook for data preprocessing, model development, and experiments.

## Status

This is an **ongoing research project**. The notebooks and results are under active development and will be updated as work progresses.
